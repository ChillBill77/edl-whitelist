# Project edl-whitelist

EDL (External Dynamic List) blacklisting, while effective for blocking known malicious domains, IPs, or URLs, is no longer sufficient in todayâ€™s rapidly evolving threat landscape. Cybercriminals constantly generate new, evasive threats that bypass blacklists faster than they can be updated. Thats why I am starting an initiative to create a whitelisting approach focuses on allowing only explicitly approved and vetted entities, creating a more proactive and controlled security model. This will help diffirentiate policies and features on trusted domains versus untrusted domains. This does not imply no more AV on O365 but skip DNS checks on certain IPs and allow a broader range of ports for optimized communications.
